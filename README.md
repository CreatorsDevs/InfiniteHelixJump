# **Helix Jump Game**

## Overview
Welcome to **Helix Jump**, an exciting 3D platform game where you control a bouncing ball that descends through a procedurally generated helix structure. Your goal is to maneuver the ball strategically to avoid falling into dangerous zones, pass through gaps between platforms, and aim for the highest score!

## Features

- **Procedurally Generated Helix Platforms**: 
  - Platforms are stacked around a central axis with randomized gaps, creating an endless, unique helix each time.
  
- **Bouncing Ball Mechanics**: 
  - Realistic physics-based bouncing on helix platforms using Unity's physics system.
  - The ball progresses downward by falling through gaps in the helix.
  
- **Player Controls**:
  - Touch/Mouse Input: Drag left or right to rotate the helix structure.
  - Keyboard Input: Use arrow keys (Left/Right) or A/D to rotate the helix.
  - Strategically maneuver the ball to fall through gaps.

- **Win and Lose Conditions**:
  - **Win Condition**: Infinite gameplay with a focus on survival and high scores.
  - **Lose Condition**: Ball hits a deadly zone or the bottom of the helix.
  
- **Scoring System**:
  - Incremental score with each platform level cleared (when the ball falls through a gap).
  - Real-time score display on the UI.

- **Game Over & Restart**:
  - Display a game over screen with the final score and highest score.
  - Restart functionality to reset the game with a new helix generation.

- **Background Music**:
  - A looping background music track to keep the game immersive, which persists across scenes.
